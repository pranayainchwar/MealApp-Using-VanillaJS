Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a web application that allows users to explore various meal recipes, search for specific dishes, mark favorites, and view comprehensive details about each meal.

Key Components:

HTML Structure: The project utilizes HTML to create the basic structure of the web pages. This includes defining the layout, headers, navigation bars, and placeholders for dynamic content.

CSS Styling: CSS is used for styling the HTML elements. This involves defining the visual appearance, layout, colors, and responsiveness of the web pages across different devices.

JavaScript Interactivity: JavaScript provides the interactivity and functionality of the web app. This includes fetching meal data from an external API, handling user interactions like searching for meals, toggling themes, displaying meal details in pop-ups, and managing favorites.

Core Features and Functions:

Display Meals: The app showcases a collection of meals as cards, each featuring an image and name. This is achieved using HTML structure and CSS styling.

Search Functionality: JavaScript fetches meal data based on user input in the search bar. It dynamically updates the displayed meals according to the search query.

Random Meal Generator: Users can trigger the random meal feature. This function fetches and displays a random meal from the database/API.

Meal Details Popup: Clicking on a meal card triggers a modal/popup window that shows comprehensive details about the selected meal. This includes ingredients, preparation instructions, and a link to watch the recipe.

Favorites Functionality: Users can mark meals as favorites by clicking a heart icon. The app stores these favorited meals locally so that users can view them later in a separate "Favorites" section.

Theme Switching: The app provides a toggle button to switch between light and dark themes. This feature changes the color scheme of the app for better user experience and readability.

Overall Impact and Purpose:

This project aims to create a user-friendly and interactive web app focused on meal exploration. It enables users to easily find, save, and explore various meal recipes, enhancing their culinary experience by offering a convenient and engaging platform for discovering new dishes.
